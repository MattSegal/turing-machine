# Turing Machine

A little webpage to play with a turning machine

Work in progress

Goal is to have an editable state machine graph and input string,
which can then be run step-by-step in the browser.

Done using learnings from [Theory of Computation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbtzT1TYeoMjNOGEiaRmm_vMIwUAidnQz)
